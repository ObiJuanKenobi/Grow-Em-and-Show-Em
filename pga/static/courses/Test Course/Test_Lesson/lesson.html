			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-3">•&#9;The seedbed for planting should be thoroughly prepared to ensure good plant stands. Soil moisture should be adequate throughout the early growing season to produce good plant growth and vigorous blossoms.

			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-2">Post-Harvest Decays </span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-3">Vegetable crops are subject to great losses after harvest because of environmental conditions and microbes. Bacteria and fungi are present in wounds and on surfaces of fresh produce. Many post-harvest pathogens cannot invade the plant unless a wound is present. Significant losses occur as these pathogens spread and increase due to improper harvesting, poor handling, and improper cooling (“Vegetable Planning Maintenance”).</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-3">Practice first-In, first-out. When stocking your food storage areas, place recently purchased items behind existing food. This will help ensure food is consumed before spoilage occurs, and before the expiration date passes.</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-3"> Maintain a storage temperature below 85°F (optimum is 50°Fto 70°F). Cooler temperatures help preserve food quality, soavoid cabinets near the oven, stove, hot pipes, or refrigeratorexhaust.</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-3">Food placement in the refrigerator affects air circulation and efficiency.  Don’t stack foods tightly, and do not cover refrigerator shelves with foil or any material that prevents air circu-lation from quickly and evenly cooling the food.  Refrigeratorswith glass shelving have air spaces at the backfor circulation that should not be blocked.</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-3">Solving refrigerator and freezer odors.  If food has beenallowed to spoil in a refrigerator or freezer, the strong odorsmay be extremely difficult to remove. If mold gets into theinsulation, the refrigerator may be impossible to clean. Somegeneral recommendations include:•  Clean the appliance with a gentle household cleaning solutionand water.•  Use a bleach solution (one tablespoon chlorine bleach pergallon of water) to rinse inside surfaces. •  Unplug the unit and leave the door open for a day or two toair it out.</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-3">•  Using a refrigerator thermometer to make sure that therefrigerator always stays at 40°F or below. See table 2 forrefrigerator and freezer times for common foods.</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-3">Washing. Fresh fruits and vegetables should be storedunwashed. Storing the produce unwashed will help preventspoilage and mold growth during storage. If fruits and vegeta-bles are very dirty after harvest, brushing or rinsing and dryingmay be necessary before storing. Wash produce just beforepreparation or eating. Food safety experts recommend thatconsumers use the six FightBAC!™ procedures for handlingfresh fruits and vegetables: Check, Clean, Separate, Cook, Chill,Throw Away, as explained in the the FightBAC!™ brochure onsafe handling fresh fruits and vegetables:</span></p>
